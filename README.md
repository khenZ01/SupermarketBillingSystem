# Project Overview (SupermarketBillingSystem)
This is an innovation project that is different from the usual billing system; where they need paper to print their receipt. But on our project there's an option where you can send it to customer's email to reduce the use of papers.

# SDG
Industry, Innovation and Infrastracture


# Details of the project (Featured)
- The System will ask if you want to save the receipt in the bill area

### Individual Assessments:

## Aldea, Francheska Noreen C.:

Creating this project taught me how simple creating program using Python Language than Java. This take us to pursue studying more about Python Languange. And now lets's talk about our project;  The Supermarket Billing System. On doing that project, it gives us an idea on how we transform the modern or the use of technology on creative way; where we can help to reduce the use of paper. By that way, we can also maintain the cleanliness in the environment even in just a simple manner.

## Ada, Jheylle Maxene P. :

In making this project this helps me to understand and learn more about python. This asess my understanding of data structures, loops, functions, classes, and libraries/modules relevant to this project.We also had a little unity and cooperation in doing this project. We learned more about how to manage the errors that appear here

## Asinas, Michaella D. :

Embarking on a Python project without much prior familiarity can indeed be a challenging yet rewarding experience, pushing you to explore, learn, and develop new skills along the way. I began by researching the basics of Python programming. I scoured through online tutorials, documentation, and YouTube videos to grasp the fundamentals.In making our project there were frustrating timesâ€”hours spent debugging, deciphering cryptic error messages, and wrestling with concepts that seemed elusive. But amidst the challenges, the satisfaction of seeing the code execute as intended was unparalleled. As the project evolved, so did my confidence. Although I'm still not an expert in Python, this experience taught me that diving into a project, even with limited knowledge, can be an incredible way to learn and grow as a programmer.

## Sobelino, James Carl A. :

Designing a supermarket billing system in Python was both challenging and rewarding. Tackling product databases, implementing pricing algorithms, and crafting a user-friendly interface pushed my coding skills. Debugging became a puzzle, and with each resolved issue, I witnessed the tangible impact of programming on practical, real-world scenarios. Crafting functions for buttons in Python GUIs was enlightening. Defining actions like opening files, processing data, or navigating screens imbued the interface with functionality. Each button became a gateway to a specific task, offering a seamless and interactive user experience. It's the art of turning clicks into meaningful actions.
